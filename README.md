# Energized
[Energized](http://www.wowace.com/addons/energized/) is a addon for World of Warcraft created by [Allara](http://www.wowace.com/profiles/Allara/).

#### Description
Inspired by the now discontinued add-on BuffEnough, Energized answers the simple question: "Am I buffed?" Energized functions as a LibDataBroker (LDB) feed whose icon changes depending on your disposition. The tooltip lists which buffs you're missing, along with who is likely to be responsible for the buff. Energized is optimized for max-level players, and primarily focuses on PvE (but also supports PvP content).
